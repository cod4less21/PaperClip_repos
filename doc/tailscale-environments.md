# Run agent tasks on a Tailscale machine

A Tailscale environment runs tasks on an existing machine that you own. Paperclip
connects to its SSH server through your tailnet. It uses the same task execution,
workspace synchronization, logs, and cancellation paths as an SSH environment.

In **Environments**, add an environment and select **Tailscale**. Enter the
machine's MagicDNS name or Tailscale IP address, SSH port, SSH username, and an
absolute workspace path. Configure the SSH private key and trusted host keys as
you would for an SSH environment. The machine needs a working SSH server and the
runtime prerequisites for your selected agent runner.

Create a device auth key in the destination tailnet and enter it in **Tailscale
connection key**. Save the environment, then select **Test connection** from the
environment list. Assign this environment to the agent or execution workspace
that should run tasks on the machine. The tailnet policy must allow the Paperclip
connection to reach the machine's SSH port. Tailscale network authorization and
SSH authentication are separate: use the credentials accepted by that machine's
SSH server, including its Tailscale SSH policy when enabled.

Paperclip joins a small network client to the tailnet. It does not create or
replace the target machine. The client uses userspace networking, accepts no
subnet routes or DNS changes, and blocks incoming connections. Each connection
has a private socket and state directory. Connections from different companies
use separate identities. A saved connection secret can be shared deliberately
by multiple environments in its company.

This transport currently supports one serving process per Paperclip instance.
Do not restore the same connection identity in separate server replicas at the
same time. Replicated execution needs a shared connection-ownership lease before
it can use this transport.

The initial key is stored through the configured company secret provider. After
the first connection, Paperclip replaces its current secret value with the
Tailscale node state before allowing task execution. This preserves the identity
across restarts and allows single-use auth keys. The key and node state never
appear in environment API responses, task arguments, or logs. The local key file
is removed after login. Node state is restored into a private temporary directory
and removed when the network client stops. The host requires `tailscale` and
`tailscaled` on its PATH. The production and Cloud Docker targets supply
checksum-pinned 1.104.5 binaries for Linux amd64 and arm64. Their build runs both
programs as the unprivileged node user. The PR image check also builds and tests
the client stage. No daemon starts for direct SSH environments or during server
startup.

Enter a new auth key to reconnect when a node is revoked, its key expires, or
the machine moves to another tailnet. Deleting an environment removes its secret
binding. Company secrets and registered tailnet nodes have their own lifecycle;
remove unused credentials and nodes through their respective settings. Paperclip
does not delete a machine that you own.

This setup uses [device auth keys](https://tailscale.com/docs/features/auth-keys).
It does not need an Apps connector or an OAuth app. Tailscale currently limits
[OAuth app consent](https://tailscale.com/docs/features/oauth-apps) to users in
the app's own tailnet, so one shared Cloud app cannot authorize every customer's
tailnet. A device auth key supports an existing machine in either tailnet.

Local tests use child-process fixtures and make no provider calls. Before a
release, qualify a real tailnet: save a single-use key, run a task that writes
a file on the target, read the result through Paperclip, restart the Cloud
instance, and repeat without entering another key. Also test a denied tailnet
policy and a revoked node. Fixture tests do not establish this live proof.

The connection manager uses one network identity per authorized company secret.
SSH receives only a server-resolved socket and identity. Environment configuration
cannot set the runtime socket path. The temporary socket lives under `/tmp` so
its path stays short and contains no shell metacharacters when OpenSSH evaluates
ProxyCommand. Target hosts and socket paths are validated before that command is
created. Startup readiness has a fixed deadline and each client call has a
timeout. Login has a separate thirty-second limit. Neither starts an idle
polling loop.

When a network client stops, new tasks wait for its state write and cleanup before
connecting again. A replacement client reloads the latest authorized secret
version after that wait. Shutdown also cancels queued reconnects and pending
credential loads so they cannot start another daemon after cleanup.
